This website has officially deployed! ðŸŽ‰ Thanks to everyone who helped me make this site come to life! If you have any suggestions/want to contribute please either make a pull request or fork this repository and send it to me afterwards. If you do, please reach out to me on Discord (@Beavermon). This site is made using a combination of HTML and CSS and is hosted on Github Pages. We just recently rolled out a new training program and have big plans for 2024. Happy playing!
